title: CGNAT
---

Carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT) is a technique used by some ISPs where many customers will share one single IP address, in order to conserve the amount of IPv4 addresses the ISP owns.

Unfortunately, this also means that you will be unable to host a server from home without additional steps, as it won't be directly accessible from the wider Internet.

## Checking
(TODO)

## If you are behind CGNAT
First of all, try contacting your ISP or check their website. Some ISPs may be willing to move you onto a bare IP if requested.

If they are unwilling to do this, or require you to upgrade to a more expensive business plan, you will need to either tunnel your server or rent a VPS or dedicated server in the cloud. (TODO)
